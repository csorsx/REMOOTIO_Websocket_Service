/**
 * RemootioDevice class implements an API client for a signle device. You should create one instance per Remootio device you have.
 * The class takes care of keeping the connection alive by sending a PING message every sendPingMessageEveryXMs milliseconds to the Remootio device.
 * If no response is received within pingReplyTimeoutXMs=(sendPingMessageEveryXMs/2) time after a PING message, the connection is assumed to be broken.
 *
 * *** Constructor ***
 * The constructor takes 3 parameters: DeviceIp, ApiSecretKey, ApiAuthKey (all of them are available in the Remootio app)
 * @param {string} DeviceIp - the IP address of the Remootio device (this info is available in the Remootio app)
 * @param {string} ApiSecretKey - the API Secret Key of the Remootio device (this info is available in the Remootio app)
 * @param {string} ApiAuthKey - the API Auth Key of the Remootio device (this info is available in the Remootio app)
 * @param {string} [sendPingMessageEveryXMs=60000] - the API client sends a ping frame to the Remootio device every sendPingMessageEveryXMs milliseconds to keep the connection alive. Remootio closes the connection if no message is received for 120 seconds. If no message is received from Remootio within (sendPingMessageEveryXMs/2) milliseconds after PING frame is sent the API client considers the connection to be broken and closes it. It's not recommended to set sendPingMessageEveryXMs below 10000 (10 seconds).
 *
 * *** Properties ***
 * @property isConnected - shows if the API client is connected to the Remootio device's websocket API or not
 * @property isAuthenticated - shows if the API client is connected to the Remootio device's websocket API or not
 * @property theLastActionId - gets the id of the last action sent to the Remootio API (lastActionId), any new action sent should contain the incremented value of the the last action id modulo 0x7FFFFFFF. Incrementing this value is handled automatically by the RamootioDevice class. The only time you need this property if you want to send an arbitrary ENCRYPED frame using sendEncryptedFrame()
 *
 * *** Methods ****
 * @method connect(autoReconnect) - connect the API client to the Remootio device (via websocket)
 * @param {boolean} autoReconnect - the API client will try to reconnect to the Remootio device when the connection is lost
 *
 * @method disconnect() - disconnect the API client from the Remootio device
 *
 * @method authenticate() - authenticates the client with the Remootio API by first sending an AUTH frame, and then sending a QUERY action as a response to the authentication challenge from the server
 *
 * @method sendPing() - send a PING frame
 *
 * @method sendHello() - send a HELLO frame
 *
 * @method sendQuery() - send a QUERY action //needs authentication
 *
 * @method sendTrigger() - send a TRIGGER action //needs authentication
 *
 * @method sendTriggerSecondary() - send a TRIGGER_SECONDARY action //needs authentication
 *
 * @method sendOpen() - send a OPEN action //needs authentication
 *
 * @method sendClose() - send a CLOSE action //needs authentication
 *
 * @method holdTriggerOutputActive(durationMins) Holds the output triggered by the sendTrigger command active for durationMins
 *
 * @method holdTriggerSecondaryOutputActive(durationMins) Holds the secondary output triggered by the sendTriggerSecondary command active for durationMins
 *
 * @method holdOpenOutputActive(durationMins) Holds the output triggered by the sendOpen command active for durationMins
 *
 * @method holdCloseOutputActive(durationMins) Holds the output triggered by the sendClose command active for durationMins
 *
 * @method sendRestart() - send a RESTART action //needs authentication
 *
 * @method sendFrame(frame) - send a normal frame the sendPing and sendHello and authenticate functions above use this
 *
 * @method sendEncryptedFrame(unencryptedPayload) - send an encrypted frame the sendQuery, sendTrigger, sendOpen, sendClose, sendRestart functions use this
 *
 * *** Events ***
 * The class emits the following events:
 * @event connecting - when it tries to connect
 *
 * @event connected - when it is connected
 *
 * @event authenticated - when the authentication flow is finished (the client receives a response to his first QUERY action after the AUTH message)
 *
 * @event disconnect - when the connection is lost
 *
 * @event error - if there is any error
 *
 * @event outgoingmessage - the event is emitted whenever a message is sent to the API with the following two parameters
 * @param {Object} frame - contains the javascript object of the JSON frame
 * @param {Object} unencryptedPayload - contains the javascript object of the unencrypted payload (frame.data.payload) if it's an ENCRYPTED frame
 *
 * @event incomingmessage - the event is emitted whenever a message is received from the Remootio device with the following two parameters
 * @param {Object} frame - contains the javascript object of the JSON frame received
 * @param {Object} decryptedPayload - contains the javascript object of the decrypted payload (frame.data.payload) if it's an ENCRYPTED frame
 *
